//! @section intro License
//! Use of this program is subject to Atmel's End User License Agreement.
//!
//! Please read file  \ref lic_page for copyright notice.
//!
//! @section install Description
//! This embedded application source code illustrates how to implement a HID keyboard application
//! with the AT90USBxxx controller.
//!
//! @section src_code About the source code
//! This source code is usable with the following compilers:
//! - IAR Embedded Workbench (5.11A and higher)
//! - AVRGCC (WinAVR 20080411 and higher).
//!
//! Support for other compilers may required modifications or attention for:
//! - compiler.h file 
//! - special registers declaration file
//! - interrupt subroutines declarations
//!
//! @section Revision Revision
//!
//! @par V2.0.2
//!
//! Update license header
//! Fix compiler warning
//!
//! @par V2.0.1
//!
//! USB Stack
//! - Improve USB chap9 compliance
//! - Add three possibilities for SN on USB
//! - Move VBus interrupt to VBus pooling
//! - Fix USB constant about Device Status
//! - clean and fix specific request
//! - fix error HID class compliant
//! - WorkAround for "Transient perturbation in USB suspend mode generates overconsumption"
//!
//! New watchdog driver
//!
//! @par V2.0.0 and before
//! Old versions
//!
//! @section sample About the sample application
//! By default the sample code is delivered configured for STK525, but
//! this sample application can be configured for both STK525 or AT90USBKey hardware, see #TARGET_BOARD
//! define value in config.h file.
//!
//! @section arch Architecture
//! As illustrated in the figure bellow, the application entry point is located is the main.c file.
//! The main function first performs the initialization of a scheduler module and then runs it in an infinite loop.
//! The scheduler is a simple infinite loop calling all its tasks defined in the conf_scheduler.h file.
//! No real time schedule is performed, when a task ends, the scheduler calls the next task defined in
//! the configuration file (conf_scheduler.h).
//!
//! The sample device application is based on two different tasks:
//! - The usb_task  (usb_task.c associated source file), is the task performing the USB low level
//! enumeration process in device mode.
//! - The keyboard task performs keyboard decoding and build the HID keyboard repport.
//!
//! This demonstration application displays a welcome message generated from keyboard input when
//! pushing the select button of the joystick.
